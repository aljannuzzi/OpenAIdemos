// Pull Request Review
//
// This code looks good overall. However, there are a few things that could be improved:

// 1. The dictionaries for commandProducers and sagaStatePersisters could be converted to use the new C# 9 record types for improved readability.

// 2. Consider adding comments to explain the purpose of each dictionary.

// 3. The try/catch block should have a more specific exception as the catch argument, rather than the general ArgumentException.

// 4. The logging at the end of the function should include the sagaState as well as the instanceId.
